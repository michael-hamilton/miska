    <p>I am a web application developer working mostly in <b>Node.js</b>.  I love the opportunity to learn new languages or frameworks and strive to use the best tools available to get the job done.</p>
    <p>I am comfortable using Node and many of it's frameworks to tackle projects from database-driven applications using <b>MongoDB</b>, to realtime applications using <b>Socket.io</b>.</p>
    <p>I've also worked a lot in the <b>LAMP</b> stack building web applications using <b>PHP</b> along with <b>MySQL.</b></p>
    <p>While I spend most of my time developing on the backend, I spend plenty of time working on the front end in <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>Javascript</b>.  I am very well versed in <b>jQuery</b>, along with many other front end libraries and frameworks like <b>Ember</b> and <b>Bootstrap</b>.  I've worked equally on a team as I have individually, and in both cases I've used some kind of version control system whether it be <b>Git</b> or <b>Subversion</b>.</p>
    <p>In my free time I've been interested in learning more about functional languages via languages like <b>Haskell</b> and <b>Elm</b>, as well as functional programming in <b>Javascript</b>.</p>
