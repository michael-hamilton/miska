Application used to allow parishioners to engage in the church in some way, either by making requests to serve, tithe, join a small group, receive a daily email, or invite a friend.  App was developed in Node.js using the Express framework.  MongoDB was used as the database.  A custom, responsive framework was used for development on the front end.  Application was deployed locally and run on iPad “Kiosks” throughout the building.  Other services used included Stripe for payment processing, Mandrill for transactional email and MailChimp’s API to manage email lists through the application.
