Registration website for annual church conference.  Project included designing and developing a public facing fronted for users to register, a public facing backend for users to modify their registration, and a private backend for administration over registrations.
Website was developed in PHP and Javascript.  PayPal was used to process credit card transactions seamlessly without taking users away from the site.  Mandrill was used to send transactional email to users.  Bootstrap was used on the frontend for responsive development.
